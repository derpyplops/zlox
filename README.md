# zlox

`zlox` is an interpreter for the Lox language described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), written in Scala with the `zio` library.

## WIP
- try zio-parser
- clean up the packages and organize imports etc
- do the challenges
- go beyond: it would be cool to implement some beloved features in zlox like pattern matching, error handling, and some other FP features.
